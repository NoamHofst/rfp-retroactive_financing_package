# rfp-retroactive_financing_package
This repository contains different ideas and methods + implementation + documentation for dynamic, modular retroactive financing of specific projects

The immediate need for RFP stemms from present real-life situations of extreme, mass emergencies tackled by Civil Society ascention and growing exhaustion alongside complete collapse of the most relevant State mechanisms.
That said, the quest for non-institutional funding of Civil Society and decentralized organization and funding models is much more general and ancient than any recent events

This repository contains one working option for a retroactive, activity-based funding model to foster immediate Civil Society needs, at the service of the higher level purpose 

## The 0.1 version is a package of google files:
(1) A google form, [url]

(2) A googlesheet containing computation, documentation, interface, imported data tabs

(3) A googlesheet containing the google form data as inserted

## Tasks at hand:
- Separate existing google form to two forms: Intake and Monthly Report
- Separate tabs to different (connected) functional sheets: (Computations + imported data sheets), interface sheet, documentation sheet.
